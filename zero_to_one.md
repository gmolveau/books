# Zero To One

> Zero To One, Notes on startups or How to build the future - Peter THIEL - ISBN:978-0-75355-520-0

four big lessons from the dot-com crash that sill guide business thinking today :

1. make incremental advances
2. stay lean and flexible
3. improve on the competition
4. focus on product, not sales

instead the opposite is probably true :

1. it is better to risk boldness than triviality
2. abad plan is better than no plan
3. competitive markets destroy profits
4. sales matters just as much as product

if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undeifferentiated commodity business

all failedcompany are the same, they failed to escape competition


if you can't beat your rival, it may be better to merge

characteristics of monopoly :

1. proprietary technology
  must be 10x time better than competition
2. network effect
3. economics of sales
4. branding

building a monopoly :

1. start small and monopolize
2. scaling up
  once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.
3. don't disrupt

we all sell things :

- the founders don't know what to do with the money, so they give it to a large bank
- the bankers don't know what to do with it, so they diversify by spreading it across a porfolio of insitutional investors
- insitutional inverstors don't know what to do with their managed capital, so they diversify by amassing a portfolio of stocks
- companies try to increase their share price by generating fee cash flows. if they do, they issue dividends or buy back shares and the cycle repeats.

so who do you tell (the secrets of you startup) ? whoever you need to and no more. every great business is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. a great company is a conspiracy to change the world

- ownership : who legally owns a company's equity ?
- possession : who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis ?
- control : who formally governs the company's affaires ?

a board of three is ideal.
everyone you involve in your company should be involved full-time.

on the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work.

silicon valley is where engineers are biased toward building cool stuff rather han selling it.

people who sell advertising are called "account executives". People who sell customers work in "business development". People who sell companies are "investments bankers". And people who sell themselves are called "politicians".There'sa reason for these redescriptions: none of us wants to be reminded when we're being sold.

nerds who instinctively mistrust the media often make the mistake of trying to ignore it.

look around, if you don't see any sales-people; you're the salesperson.

computers are tools, not rivals.

if linkedin had tried to simply replace recruiters with technology, they wouldn't have a business today.

seven questions every business must answer :

1. The engineering question :
  can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements ?
2. The timing question :
  Is now the right time to start your particular business ?
3. The monopoly question :
  Are you starting with a big share of a small market ?
4. The people question :
  Do you have the right team ?
5. The distribution question :
  Do you have a way to no just create but deliver your product ?
6. The durability question :
  Will your market position be defensible 10 ans 20 years into the future ?
7. The secret question :
  Have you indentified a unique opportunity that others don't see ?

Customers won't care about any particular technology unless it solves a particular problem in a superior way.

Exaggerating your own uniqueness is an easy way to botch the monopoly question.

just as corporations tend to copy each other, nonprofits all tend to push the same priorities.

the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.
