## Notes

### Chapter 1

Money is the medium by which earthly success is measured.

Money makes possible the enjoyment of the best the earth affords.

Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its aquisition.

Money is governed today by the same laws which controlled it when prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, six thousand years ago.

### Chapter 2

Thou makest me to realize the reason why we have never found any measure of wealth. We never sought it.

### Chapter 3

Remember this, the sun that shines today is the sun that shone when thy father was born, and will still be shining when thy last grandchild shall pass into the darkness.

"A part of all you earn is yours to keep. It should not be less than a tenth no matter how little you earn. It can be as much more as you can afford. Pay yourself first."

"Wealth, like a tree, grows from a tiny seed. The first copper you save is the seed from which your tree of wealth shall grow. The sooner you plant that seed the sooner shall the tree grow. And the more faithfully you nourish and water that tree with consistent savings, the ssoner may you bask in contentment beneath its shade."

"You first learned to live upon less than you could earn. Next you lerned to seek advice from those who were competent through their own experiences to give it. And, lastly, you have learned to make gold work for you."

"Opportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared."

"When I set a task for myself, I complete it. Therefore, I am careful not to start difficult and impractical tasks, because I love leisure."

"Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain or try to save too much. If one-tenth of all you earn is as much as you can comfortably keep, be content to keep this portion. Live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwile and things to enjoy."

### Chapter 6

"What each of us calls our 'necessary expenses' will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary. Confuse not the necessary expanses with thy desires."

### Chapter 7

The money lender explained that because this sum had been increased by compound interest, the original ten pices of silver had now grown to thirty and one-half pieces.

### Chapter 8

Every owner of gold is tempted by opportunities whereby it would seem that he could make large sums by its investment in most plausible projects. Oftern friends and relatives are eagerly entering such investment and urge him to follow.

Study carefully, before parting with thy treasure, each assurance that it may be safely reclaimed. Be not misled by thine own romantic desires to make wealth rapidly.

Before thou loan it to any man assure thyself of his abilty yo repay and his reputation for doing so, that thou mayest not unwittingly be making him a present of thy hard-earned treasure.

Before thou entrust it as an investment in any field acquaint thyself with the dangers which may beset it.

### Chapter 9

To own his own domiciel and to have it a place he is proud to care for, putteth confidence in his heart and greater effort behind all his endeavors. Thefore, do I recommend that every man own the roof that sheltereth him and his.

### Chapter 10

It behooves a man to make preparation for a suitable income in the days to come, when he is no longer young, and to make preparations for his family should he be no longer with them to comfort and support them.

A man may buy houses or lands for this purpose (safety for his future). If wisely chosen as to their usefulness and value in the future, they are permanent in their value and their earnings or their sale will provide well for his purpose.

### Chapter 11

In learning to secure his one definite small desire, he had trained himself to secure a larger one. This is the process by which wealth is accumulated: first in small sums, then in larger ones as a man learns and becomes more capable.

The more of wisdom we know, the more we may earn. That man who seeks to learn more of his craft shall be richly rewarded. If he is an artisan, he may seek to learn the methods and the tools of the most skillful in the same line.

I urge all men to be in the front rank of progress and not to stand still, lest they be left behing.

He must pay his debts with all the promptness within his power, not purchasing that for which he is unable to pay.

He must have compassion upon those who are injured and smitten by misfortune and aid them within reasonable limits. He must do deeds of thoughfulness to those dear to him.

### Chapter 12

Good luck follows opportunity. Good luck can be enticed by accepting opportunity.

### Chapter 15

Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.

### Chapter 20

Youth, never having had experience, cannot realize that hopeless debt is like a deep pit into which one may descend quickly and one may struggle vainly for many days. It is a pit of sorrow and regrets where the brightness of the sun overcast and night is made unhappy by restless sleeping.

I am a gold lender because I own more gold than I can use in my own trade. I desire my surplus gold to labor for others and thereby earn more gold. I do not wish to take risk of losing my gold for I have labored much and denied myself much to secure it. There, I will no longer lend any of it where I am not confident that it is safe and will be returned to me. Neither will I lend it where I am not convined that its earnings will be promptly paid to me.

Be not swayed by foolish sentiments of obligation to trust thy treasure to any person. If thou wouldst help thy family of thy friends, find other ways than risking the loss of thy treasure.

BETTER A LITTLE CAUTION THAN A GREAT REGRET.

### Chapter 22

WHERE THE DETERMINATION IS, THE WAY CAN BE FOUND.

### Chapter 24

Therefore seven-tenths of all I earn shall be used to provide a home, clithes to wear, and food to eat, with a bit extra to spend, that our lives be not lacking in pleasure and enjoyment.
