It is what they do. Foresight isn't a mysterious gift bestowed at birth. It is the product of particular wars of thinking, of gathering information, of updating beliefs.

This is what psychologists call confirmation bias. We rarely seek  out evidence that undercuts our first exaplanation, and when that evidence is shoved under our noses we become motivated skeptics; finding reasons, however tenuous, to belittle it or throw it out entirely.

That's excellent parctice. The tip-of-your-nose perspective can work wonders but it can also go terribly awry, so if you have the time to think befoer making a big decision, do so; and be prepared to accept that what seems obviously true now may turn out to be false later.

The national security elites looked a lot like the renowned physicians from the prescientific era. They too overflowed with intelligence and integrity. But tip-of-your0nose delusions can fool anyone, even the best and brightestl perhaps especially the best and the brightest.

Larry KUDLOW

"We are in a mental recession, not an actual recession" he wrote,a theme he kept repeating until Septembre 15, when Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, Wall Street was thrown into chaos, the global financial system froze, and people all over the world feltlike passengers in a plunging jet, eyes wide, fingers digging into armrests.

How could Kudlow be so consistently wrong ? Like all of us, hedgehog forecasters first see things from the tip-of-your-nose perspective. [...] But the hedgehog also "knows one big thing", the Big Idea the uses over and over when trying to figure out what will happen next.

thank to IARPA, we now know a few hundrer ordinary people and some simple math can not only compete with professionals supported by a multibillion-dollar apparatus but also beat them.

regression to the mean is as easy to forget as it is to understand. Say you suffer from chronic back pain. Not all days are the same. Some days, you feel fine; others, you feel some pain but not a lot; and occasionally it's awful. Of courseit's when you have one of those awful days that you are most likely to seek help by visiting a homeopath of some other dispenser of medical treatments unsupported by solid evidence. the next day you wake up and ... you feel better ! the treatment works ! the placebo effect may have heped, but you probably would have felt better the next day even if you had received no treatment at all.


Fermi style question :  
Here's a question that definitely was not asked in the forecasting tournament : How many piano tuners are there in Chicage ?

I could nail this question if I knew four facts

1. The number of pianos in Chicage
2. How often pianos are tuned each year
3. How long it takes to tune a piano
4. How many hours a year the average piano tuner works

How likely is it that the Renzettis have a pet ?
The first thing superforcasters would do is find out what percentage of American households own a pet. Statisticians call that the base rate -- how common something  is within a broader class.

Why do superforecasters put so much into forecasting ? One anwser is it's fun. "Need for cognition" is the psychological term for the tendency to engage in and enjoy hard mental slogs. People high in need for cognition are the sort who like crosswords and Sudoku puzzles, the harder, the better.

Active open-mindedness (AOM) is a concept coined by the psychologist Jonathan BARON, who has an office next to mine at the University of Pennsylvania. Baron's test for AOM asks whether you agree or disagree with statements like:

> People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their beliefs.  
>   
> It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you than to pay attention to those who agree.  
>   
> Changing your mind is a sign of weakness.  
>   
> Intuition is the best guide in making decisions. 
>     
> It is important to persevere in your beliefs even when evidence is brought to bear against them.

It's a trenchant insight. When something unlikely and important happens it's deeply human to ask "Why?"

> "there is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction. [...] Learn from every mistake because every experience, ecounter, and particularly your mistakes are there to teach you and force you into being who you are."  
> - __Oprah WINFREY__ at _Harvard University_

Something strikingly similar happens on a cosmic scale. Think of the Big Bang, the dominant scientific explanation for the origin of the universe. Big Bang theory tells us how finely tuned the laws of nature need to be for stars, planets, and life to arise. Even tiny deviations and we would not exist. Most people don't respond to that observation by saying "Wow, we were lucky!" -- or by wonderingwhether billions of Big Bangs generated billions of parallel universes, a few of which turned out by chance to be life friendly. Some physicists think this way. But most of us suspect that something; perhaps God; wa behind it. It was _meant_ to be.

Reflecting on his own mistake, Bill told me, "I think that the question I was really answering wasn't 'Will Abe visit Yasukuni?' but 'If I were PM of Japan, would I visit Yasukuni?'". That's astute. Bill recognized that he had unconsciously pulled a bait and switch on himself, substituting an easy question in place of a hard one.

"The fact that what I expected to happen didn't happen proves that it will."

Imagine you suffer from insomnia and haven't slept properly in days and you lose your temper and shout at a colleague. Then you apologize. What does this incident say about you ? it says you need your sleep. Beyond that, it says nothing. But imagine you see someone who snaps, shouts, then apologizes and explains that he has insomnia and hasn't slept properly in days. What does that incident say about that person ? Logically, it shouldsay about him what it said about you. But decades of research suggest that's not the lesson you will draw. You will think this person is a jerk. Psychologists call this _the fundamental attribution error_.

The tournament proves it: superforcasters not only update more often than other forecasters, they in smaller increments.

__Carole DWECK__ calls it " _fixed mindset_ ". The person who thinks he is bad at math, and always will be, won't try hard to improve, because that would be pointless. He  will take any setback as further proof that his limits have been revealed and he should stop wasting his time asap. Whatever potential he had for improvement will never be realized. Thus, the belief "I am bad at math" becomes self-fulfilling.

For Keynes, failure was an opportunity to learn-- to identity mistakes, spot new alternatives, and try again.

We learn new skills by doing. We improve those skills by doing more.

Effective practice also needs to be accompanied by clear and timely feedback.

In Janis's hypothesis, "members of any small cohesive group tend to maintain _esprit de corps_ by unconsciously developing a number of shared  illusions  and related norms that interfere with critical thinking and reality testing."

Team members must disagree without being disagreeable. Practice "constructive  confrontation" to use the phrase of Andy GROVE, the former CEO of Intel.

Example: Suppose someone says "Unfortunately, the popularity of soccer, the world's favorite pastime, is starting to decline." You suspect he is wrong. How do you question the claim ? Don't even think of taking a personal shot like "You're silly", that only adds heat, not light. "I don't think so" only expresses disagreement without delving into why you disagree. "what do you mean?" lowers the emotional temperature with a question but it's much too vague. Zero in. You might say "What do you mean by 'pastime' ?" or "What evidence is there that soccer's popularity is declining ? Over what time frame ?". The answers to these precise questions won't settle the matter, but they will reveal the thinking behind the conclusion so it can be probed and tested.

Success can lead to acclaim that can undermine the habits ofmind that produced the success. Such hubris often afflicts highly accomplished individuals. In business circles, it is called CEO disease.

The command principle of _Auftragstik_. Usualy translated todayas "mission command" the basic idea is simple. "War cannot be conducted from the green table," Moltke wrote. "frequent and rapid decisions can be shaped only on the spot according to estimates of local conditions".

At work in each case was Kahneman's _WYASIATI_ -- What You See Is All There Is-the mother of all cognitive illusions, the egocentric worldview that prevents us from seeing any world beyond the one visible from the tips of our noses.

Khosla spreads his investments around, expecting more to fail, but hoping that he will, occasionally, find one or two of the ratestart-ups that beat the odds and yield a Google-size fortune. This is _black swan_ investing, similar to how Nassim TALEB himself traded.

Donald RUMSFELD (Defense Secretary) forwarded a memo to President George W. Bush. This memo looks at strategic situation at the start of each decade between 1900 and 2000 and shows that, in every case, the reality was a stunning change from ten years earlier. "All of which is to say that I'm notsure what 2010 will loke like" concluded its Author, Linton WELLS, "but I'm sure that it will be  very little like what we expect, so we should plan accordingly".

Vladimir LENIN insisted politics, defined broadly, was nothing more than a struggle for power, or as he memorably put it, "__kto kogo?__". That litteraly means "who, whom?" and it was Lenin's shorthand for "Who does what to whom?".
It follows that that the goal of forecasting is _not_ to see what's coming. It is to advance the interests of the forecaster and the forecaster's tribe.

"How does this all turn out?" is a to-big-to-answer question. This big question needs to be broken down into little questions that can be scored.

If learning, not gloating, is the goal,that is progress.

###Ten commandments for Aspiring Superforcasters

1. Triage

	Focus on quetions where your hard work is likely to pay off.  
	For instance, "Who will win the presidential election, twelve years out, in  2028?" is impossible to forecast now. Don't even try. Could you have predicted in 1940 the winner of the election, twelve years out, in 1952 ? If you think  you could have known it would be a then-unknown colonel in the United States Army, Dwight EISENHOWER, you may be afflicted by one of the worst cases of hindsight bias ever documented by psychologists.
	
2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems

	Decompose the problem into its knowable and unknowable parts. Flush ignorance into the open. Expose and examine your assumptions. Dare to be wrong by making your best guesses. Better to discover errors quickly than hide them behind vague verbiage.
	
3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views

	Superforcasters know that there is nothing new under the sun. Noting is 100% unique.
	
4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence

	 Belief updating is to good forecasting as brushing and flossing are to good dental hygiene. It can be boring, occasionally uncomfortable, but it pays off in the long term. That said, don't suppose that belief updating is always easy because it sometimes is. Skillful updating requires teasing subtle signals from noisy news flows -- all the while resisting the lure of wishful thinking.
	 
5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem

	For every good policy argument, there is typically a counterargument that is at least worth acknowledging. For instance, if you are a devout dove who believes that threatening military action never brings peace, be open to the possibility that you might be wrong about Iran. And the same advice applies if you are a devote hawk who believes that soft "appeasement" policies never pay off. Each side should list, in advance, the signs that would nudge them toward the other.  
	Now here comes the really hard part. In classical dialectics, thesis meets antithesis, producing synthesis. In dragonfly-eye, one view meets another and another and another -- all of which must be synthesized into a single image. There are no paint-by-number rules here. Synthesis is an art that requires reconciling irreducibly subjective judgments. If you do it well, engaging in this process of synthisizing should transform you from a cookie-cutter dove or hawk into an odd hybrid create, a dove-hawk, with a nuanced view of then tougher of softer policies are likelier to work.
	
6. Strive to distringuish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more

	You have an advantage if you are better than you competitors at separating 60/40 bets from 40/60 --  or 55/45 from 45/55. Translating vague-verbiage hunches into numeric probabilities.
	
7. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness
8. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror  hindsight biases

	Don't try to justify or excuse your failures. Own them! Conduct unflinching postmortems: Where exactly did I go wrong ? And remember that although the more common error is to learn too little from failure to and to overlook flawsin your basic assumptions, it is also possible to learn too much (you may have been  basically on the right track but made a minor technical mistake that had big ramifications. Also don't forget to do postmortems on your successes too. Not all successes imply that your reasoning was right. You may have just lucked out by making offsetting errors. 
	
9. Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you

	Master the fine arts of team management, especially perspective taking (understading the arguments of the other side so well that you cann reproduce them to the other's satisfaction), precision questioning (helping others to clarify their arguments so they are not misunderstood), and constructive confrontation (learning to disagree withouth being disagreeable). 
	
10. Master the error-balancing bicycle.

	Implementing each commandment requires balancing opposing erors. Just as you can't learn to ride a bicycle by reading a physics textbook, you can't become a superforcaster by reading training manuals. Learning requires doing, with good feedback that leaves no ambiguity about wether you are succeeding -- "I'm rolling along smoothly!"  -- or whether you are failing -- "crash!" Also remember that practice is not just going through the motions of making forecasts, or casually reading the news and tossing out probabilities. Like all other known forms of expertise, superforcasting isthe product of deep, deliberative practice.
	
11. Don't treat commandments as commandments
